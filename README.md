# UnityGames

A small project to scan your Steam libraries and list all the Unity games you have installed.

Created to show people which games that they play are at risk of being taken down and the devs being victims of Unity's bait-and-switch policy change regarding pricing.

I haven't really coded with .NET/C# for years so it may probably have some space for improvement.
